# portfolio-data-science
This repository includes my Data Science Portfolio.
It highlights my knowledge and skills in using Python, SQL, and R.
The projects here include the projects I have done for IBM Data Science Professional Certificate (Coursera),
Programming for Data Science (UDacity) and others.

This does not include any projects or assignments that were more of 'fill in the blank with a line of code' types.
I have only included projects and assignments where I have done all or most of the coding.
